## About Me
Hi there! I'm Shariya Ansari, an enthusiastic Information Technology student based in Mumbai, with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems — especially those that have social impact.

Currently in 3rd year, pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology at Don Bosco Institute of Technology (GPA: 9.2/10), I enjoy exploring the world of web development, data-driven applications, and community-focused tech solutions.

## What I Do
I’m passionate about full-stack development, with hands-on experience in React.js, Flask, Python, and SQL.

I build projects that combine technology and social good — like Safe Steps, a geo-spatial crime reporting tool to help protect children.

As an Instructor with Larsen & Toubro’s CrEAST Foundation, I teach STEM and digital literacy to underprivileged students, making tech more accessible.

## Beyond Code
Vice Chair of the CS Committee at IEEE DBIT: I organize tech workshops, speaker sessions, and hackathons to uplift student learning.

Part of the Tech Team at ACM Student Chapter, where I handled website updates and backend fixes.

Fluent in English, Hindi, and German, I believe communication is just as important as code!
